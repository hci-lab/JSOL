## Overview
The JavaScript Open-source Library _(JSOL)_ is a free open-source web-based visualization library based on the Grammar of Graphics textbook by Wilkinson, Leland in 2005 which is published by Springer-Verlag (ISBN: 0387245448). The library uses JavaScript and [SVG](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) for visualizing, and JavaScript Object Notation _(JSON)_ to interpret user's specifications.
## Installation
You can start using JSOL by running:

    git clone git@github.com:hci-lab/gog-lib.git
    
## Cheatsheet
[Examples](https://github.com/hci-lab/gog-lib/tree/master/examples) directory comprises many examples from which you can see how every charting is generated.
## Usage
